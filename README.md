I hope to build this in to an easy to use library for common numerical methods
ranging from root finders to ODE/PDE solvers. At it's current state, it has
functions for finding roots of single equations, systems of linear equations,
and systems of nonlinear equations. This initial commit is mostly to refamiliarize
myself with basic concepts. Many test examples come from "Introduction to Numerical
Methods and Matlab Programming for Engineers" by Young and Mohlencamp, although
this is implemented in Python.
